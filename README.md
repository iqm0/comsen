## A Common Sense Approach to Software Development

Welcome to ComSen, the Common Sense framework for software development teams who value flexibility, collaboration, and the human element in their projects. ComSen (short for Common Sense) is a manifesto, an idea, a methodology designed to break free from the rigid confines of traditional software development practices, offering a breath of fresh air to small teams everywhere.

### Our Philosophy

In a world dominated by inflexible methodologies and prescriptive practices, ComSen stands out by championing the principles of flexibility, individuality, and simplicity. Born from real-world frustrations and the insights of a lone developer in a moment of clarity, ComSen is more than just a methodology; it's a call to rethink how we approach software development.

### Core Principles

- __Flexibility Over Rigidity__: Every team is unique, and so should be their approach to managing projects. ComSen adapts to you, not the other way around.
- __Individuals and Interactions__: We put people first, emphasizing the well-being and growth of team members, recognizing that satisfied people deliver exceptional work.
- __Practicality and Adaptability__: Embracing change and learning from both successes and failures are at the heart of ComSen, ensuring continuous improvement.
- __Simplicity in Execution__: In an increasingly complex world, simplicity remains our north star, making work enjoyable and productive.

### The ComSen Framework

At its core, ComSen is about understanding and adapting to the dynamics of small teams, providing a flexible framework that can be tailored to any project or team's needs.

### Key Components

- __North Star Initiatives__: Single, overarching goals that guide the team's efforts, focusing on what truly matters.
- __Three-Scenario Planning__: Tasks are approached with a mindset that considers the best, worst, and most likely scenarios, ensuring a balanced view of potential outcomes.
- __Task Vitality Tracking__: Visual indicators, such as the health of a plant, reflect the progress and urgency of tasks, adding a layer of engagement and intuition to project management.
- __Democratic Decision-Making__: Team-wide votes on key decisions foster a culture of inclusivity and shared ownership, aligning projects with the collective wisdom of the team.
- __Transparency and Learning__: Successes and failures are shared openly, not just within the team but across the organization, amplifying learning opportunities.

### Getting Started

ComSen is currently a manifesto and methodology that can be applied within existing project management tools. While we envision integrating ComSen into a dedicated productivity board akin to Jira or Asana, we encourage teams to adopt and adapt these principles within their current frameworks.

### How to Use ComSen
- __Read the Manifesto__: Familiarize yourself with the core principles and components of ComSen.
- __Implement Gradually__: Start with one or two components that resonate most with your team's needs and gradually integrate more as you see fit.
- __Share Your Experiences__: We believe in learning from the community. Share your successes, challenges, and insights, and let's grow together.

### Contributing to ComSen
ComSen is an open-source idea, and we welcome contributions from the community. Whether it's feedback, suggestions, or your own experiences with implementing ComSen, your input is invaluable in evolving this framework.

Join us in redefining software development for small teams, making it more humane, flexible, and effective. Because at the end of the day, common sense should prevail.
